Projects for CalgaryHacks 2019

The Bin Buddy

Developed an app that would allow users to take pictures of their trash, and automatically tell them if it belonged in the compost, recycling, or garbage bins

Used Firebase's ML Kit for the image recognition and Android Studio for the app development.
